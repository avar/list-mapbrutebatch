=head1 NAME

List::MapBruteBatch - Do a brute-force batched C<map()> though a list with a callback

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    map_brute_batch($cb, \@list);
    my @ret = map_brute_batch($cb, \@list, \$cb_success, \$cb_failure);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Firstly. Why would you use this?

You have some C<N> number of items you want to process. You have some
function that can take those C<N>, and it's much cheaper to do them in
one big batch than one at a time.

However, any one of the C<N> items can fail, causing the entire batch
of C<N> to fail with it. When that happens you either don't know which
one failed the batch, or finding out would be tedious.

This module provides a C<map()>-like function to solve that
problem. It'll attempt to process a C<\@list> you provide with a
C<$cb> function that you provide.

If your C<$cb> doesn't return true we bisect the C<\@list> and call
your C<$cb> on each half of the bisected list, and if those fail we
repeat this process until we're processing one item, which may also
fail.

You can optionally provide C<$cb_success> or C<$cb_failure> callbacks,
those'll be called in C<map()>-like fashion on items that fail or
succeed, respectively. You can use this to make the function return a
list of items showing which items ended up failing or succeeding.
